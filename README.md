# spherical_model_rubber_elasticity

I propose a numerical model for modelling the behaviour of elastomers under deformations. The proposed model is based on a spherically oriented network of polydisperse N chain. It contains five physically motivated parameters and two computational parameters which need to be determined on the basis of experimental data.

The model is able to predict experimental results under uniaxial deformation, equibiaxial deformation and pure shear with excellent accuracy. The inclusion of a damage parameter allows for the prediction of the [Mullins effect](https://abaqus-docs.mit.edu/2017/English/SIMACAEMATRefMap/simamat-c-mullins.htm) and the innate representative directions due to the spherical orientation of the network predicts anisotropic softening in agreement with experiment.

This work is based on my [masters thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sbm8yCoAqp042DqZWpC2vrmxCLPt74Et/view?usp=sharing) which I suggest reading for a full understanding of the model. I also suggest looking at [this](https://github.com/moe9195/RubberPhysics/blob/master/elastomers_deformation_models.ipynb) and [this](https://github.com/moe9195/RubberPhysics/blob/master/elastomers_deformation_models.ipynb) first to understand the functions used in this project. For any questions unanswered by the thesis, please feel free to email me your questions at [moerahmeh95@hotmail.com](mailto:moerahmeh95@hotmail.com).
